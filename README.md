# get_the_Prometheus_Collection
A script to fetch the torrent file for each data-set in the Project Prometheus collection.

Since October, 2015 I have recorded my contemplation, speculation, design ideas, analysis, etc. via dictation and a hand-held, digital audio recorder. These records are stored at Archive.org and accessible though bit-torrent.
